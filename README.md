# Simple proxy service

## Purpose

A small proxy service written in Go that sits between client and server.

## Usage

At the top of the file `main.go` we need to change `URL` and set existing running system.

## Start

```go
go run main.go
```

Service will run under the: `localhost:8080`


Ideally it should be dockerized.
